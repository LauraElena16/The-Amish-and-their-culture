        <p class="u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The term Amish was first used as a term of
disgrace in 1710 by Jakob Amman's opponents. The first informal division
between Swiss Brethren was recorded in the 17th century between those who lived
in the hills and those who lived in the Emmental valley. Those who lived in the
hills were a more extreme congregation; their zeal drove them to more distant
areas, and loneliness made them more zealous.</p>
        <div class="u-palette-5-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-1"></div>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Swiss Anabaptism developed, from
this point on, into two parallel streams, most clearly marked by disagreement
over the preferred treatment of "fallen" believers. Those living in
the Emmental Valley argued that fallen believers should be restrained only from
communion, not from ordinary meals. The Amish argued that those who were banned
should be avoided even in regular meals. The Reistian side eventually formed
the basis of the Swiss Mennonite Conference. Due to this common heritage, the
Amis and Mennonites in southern Germany and Switzerland retain many
similarities. Those who leave the Amish rock tend to join the various
congregations of conservative Mennonites.</p>
        <img src="images/dd977dea554b3ebcf8d1ec90ab14aee6.jpg" alt="" class="u-image u-image-default u-image-1" data-image-width="371" data-image-height="530">
        <p class="u-text u-text-4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most of the Amish communities that were established in North America did
not ultimately retain their Amish identity. The major division that led to the
loss of the identity of many Amish congregations took place in the third
quarter of the 19th century. The formation of the fractions worked at different
times, in different places. The process was a "sorting" rather than a
division. Amish people are free to join another Amish congregation in another
place that suits them best.</p>
        <div class="u-palette-5-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-2"></div>
        <p class="u-text u-text-5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The more progressive members, who
comprised about two-thirds of the group, became known as Amish menites and
eventually united with the Mennonite Church and other Mennonite denominations,
especially in the early twentieth century. More traditional groups became known
as the Old Amish Order. Egli Amish had already begun to withdraw from the Amish
church in 1858. They soon moved away from the old ways and changed their name
to "Defenseless Mennonite" in 1908. Congregations that did not take
part in the division after 1862 formed the Conference. Amish Mennonite
conservatives in 1910, but gave up the word "Amish" in their name in
1957.</p>
        <img src="images/De_Ausbund_329.jpg" alt="" class="u-image u-image-default u-image-2" data-image-width="170" data-image-height="351">
        <p class="u-text u-text-6">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As there was no division in Europe, the
remaining congregations there took on the same path as the Mennonites who were
thinking about change in North America and slowly merged with the Mennonites.
The last Amish congregation in Germany to merge was the Ixheim Amish
Congregation, which merged with the neighboring Mennonite church in 1937. Some
Mennonite congregations, including most in Alsace, came directly from former
Amish congregations.</p>
        <div class="u-palette-5-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-3"></div>
        <p class="u-text u-text-7">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
there were divisions between the Old Order in the 19th century in Mifflin
County, Pennsylvania, a major split between the Old Order took place until
World War I. At that time, two very conservative affiliations emerged -
Swartzentruber Amish of Holmes County, Ohio and Buchanan Amish of Iowa. The
Buchanan Amish soon joined congregations with similar thoughts throughout the
country.</p>
        <img src="images/download3.jfif" alt="" class="u-image u-image-default u-image-3" data-image-width="273" data-image-height="184">
        <p class="u-text u-text-8">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With World War I came the massive
suppression of the German language in the United States, which eventually led
to the change of language of most German speakers in Pennsylvania, leaving the
Amish and other old orders as almost the only speakers by the end of the
twentieth century. This created a language barrier around the Amish that did
not exist before in this form.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-9">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late 1920s, the changing faction of
the old Amish order, which wanted to adopt the car, broke away from the
mainstream and organized itself as the Beachy Amish.</p>
        <div class="u-palette-5-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-4"></div>
        <img src="images/download21.jfif" alt="" class="u-image u-image-default u-image-4" data-image-width="300" data-image-height="168">
        <p class="u-text u-text-10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
World War II, the old issue of military service for the Amish reappeared.
Because young Amish generally refused military service, they ended up in the
Civilian Civil Service, where they worked mainly in forestry and hospitals. The
fact that many young people worked in hospitals, where they had a lot of
contacts with the more progressive Mennonites and with the outside world, led
to the result that many of these men never joined the Amish church.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-11">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the 1950s, Beachy Amish was
transformed into an evangelical church. Those who wanted to keep the old way of
Beachy became Old Beachy Amish.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the 1950s, almost all Amish children attended small, local, non-Amish
schools, but then school consolidation and compulsory schooling after 8th grade
provoked Amish opposition. Amish communities have opened their own Amish
schools. In 1972, the United States Supreme Court exempted Amish students from
8th grade compulsory education. By the end of the twentieth century, almost all
Amish children attended Amish schools.</p>
        <div class="u-palette-5-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-5"></div>
        <img src="images/846269_63c8863cc527421a82dbeaed7c9ac195.gif" alt="" class="u-image u-image-default u-image-5" data-image-width="293" data-image-height="374">
        <p class="u-text u-text-13">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last quarter of the twentieth century,
a growing number of Amish men left farm work and started small businesses due
to increasing pressure on small-scale agriculture. Although there is a wide
variety of small businesses among the Amish, construction work and woodworking
are quite widespread. In many Amish settlements, especially the largest ones,
farmers are now a minority. Approximately 12,000 of the 40,000 dairy farms in
the United States have been owned by Amish since 2018.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-14">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the beginning of the twentieth century,
the identity of the Old Amish Order was not related to the use of technology,
because the Old Amish Order and their rural neighbors used the same
agricultural and household technologies. Questions about the use of technology
played no role in the Old Order division of the second half of the nineteenth
century. Telephones were the first major technology to be rejected, soon
followed by the rejection of cars, tractors, radios, and many other
twentieth-century technological inventions.</p>
