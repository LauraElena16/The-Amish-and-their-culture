        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Amish family is the basis of the Amish way of life. The family
structure and traditions that seem to be taken from a page in history have
remained an integral part of Amish culture. They have an unwritten plan for the
Amish life called Ordnung, which guides them through all the details of daily
life. To us, these rules might seem extremely legalistic. But the Amish
consider the Ordnung as a sacred trust that separates them from the outside
world. They bind them together in search of eternal salvation and create a
desire for unity and conformity. When its members live together, work together,
worship together and socialize together, the Amish family grows stronger.</p>

        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Amish men and women usually take on
traditional gender roles. Spouses are primarily responsible for the financial
well-being of the family. Wives usually dedicate themselves to housekeeping and
motherhood. As in most families, gender roles in Amish marriages vary by
personality. In non-farm families, the husband is usually the main supporter,
but in cases where a wife owns a business, she can provide most of the family's
income. When husbands work at home, there is often a considerable division of
roles - women helping in the barn or shop and men helping in the garden or
around the house.</p>

children almost never work full-time jobs outside the home, although some run
home shops, greenhouses or bakeries. In some communities, single women or those
whose children are raised run their own businesses.</p>

participate in household decision-making and children's discipline, even if
they claim the man's role as the religious leader of the household. Although
the father serves as the spiritual head of the house, the mothers are very
active in feeding the children's spiritual life. The husband is responsible for
religious matters related to the church and the outside world. Family members
help each other in case of emergency, fire or flood and, of course, when death
occurs.</p>

eight years in a one-room school, taught by an eighth-grade teacher. In
reality, this seems to be an extremely inappropriate and unfair way to prepare
Amish children for adult life as productive members of so​ciety The purpose Amish education is not to
promote individuality and critical thinking. The goal is teaching children the
worth of hard work, ethical living, and how to be a valuable member of the
Amish community. Amish education does not seek to create artists, scientists,
musicians or actors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;

        <p class="u-text u-text-3">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mission of Amish education is to teach the skills that are needed to lead a useful Amish life while developing the ability to function and do business in the outside world. But it also promotes separateness from the world. Amish view education as the responsibility of the parents, the school and the entire community acting, as always, under the influence the church.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-4">For Amish people, children are looked as a gift from God. From birth
until they start wal​king children are cared and caressed by all members of the

        <p class="u-text u-text-5">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the period between when a
small child starts walking and when the child starts school, Amish education
begins at home. Children speak only the Amish German dialect before they start
school. They are taught to be obedient to older members of the family. They are
taught to share with their siblings. They are assigned chores to create a good
attitude toward work. Amish pre-school children are given a lot of freedom to
tag along with adults and older siblings as they go through daily chores and
routines observing and learning. The Amish have no pre-schools. They believe
that is important that very young children are with their parents and learning
under their guidance.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At age
six, Amish children start first grade. They go to a one-room school that
includes grades one through eight. There are usually 30-35 scholars, many of
which are siblings and cousins. School is usually very close to home. English,
reading, writing, arithmetic and history are taught in Amish school. These are
considered all the skills that are needed to lead an Amish life and yet be able
to do business with the outside world.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Following the old traditions of
one-room schools, classes begin at 8:30am and end at 3:30pm. The day is divided
into 4 periods with recess and lunch between. At recess and lunch, the children
play and do a lot of exercise. They will be played in the playground that is
found at each school. The day begins with bible reading, hymn singing, and
reciting the prayer of God. Religion is not taught in school. This is the
responsibility of the parents and the church.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-8">Teachers
are chosen from community members. A new teacher is usually a young girl. It is
very important that she be strong in the faith and stick to the Amish way of
thinking as she teaches the children. Of course, she must have the intelligence
and ability to teach all school subjects.</p>
        <div class="u-palette-2-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-4"></div>
        <p class="u-text u-text-9">The new teacher first serves an apprenticeship with
an experienced teacher. When she is ready, she starts teaching at the school
where she was hired. For help as he gains experience, he can attend meetings
with other local teachers to discuss issues and exchange ideas.</p>

education moves from school, back home and community. Some boys return to the
farm to continue learning agricultural skills. Others could be apprentices to
Amish store owners or craftsmen who learn skills that will ensure their
existence for themselves and their future families. The girls return home to
work with their mothers, polishing their home skills.</p>

weddings were traditionally held on Tuesdays or Thursdays, later in the autumn,
after harvest. Now weddings are held throughout the year and on other days to
accommodate the large number of couples getting married. A couple will not
announce their engagement until just a few weeks before the wedding. They
usually do not wear white, but one of the most acceptable colors in their
group. They are very careful in choosing fabrics and colors.</p>

Amish Country weddings are usually a time where English friends are invited to
join, both at work and in the meal following. Preparation for the meal requires
lots of help from the community. That's because the meal usually serves 200-600
persons. A group of women will gather a day or two before the wedding to set up
the tables in the house.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The
head table has places set for the wedding party and their attendants. This
group could number up to 20. There are special napkins with the couple's names
on them, pens with the date commemorated and other favors. Because of the size
of the group, a cooking tent is often set up to accommodate the portable stoves
and food preparation areas needed for such

worship service. The Bishop and ministers preside. The couple takes their vows
before the church.</p>

the celebration continues with the meal. The Amish wedding meal is usually
typical fare with fried or roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy and other
vegetables. The typical foods at an Amish wedding have sparked a cottage
industry in making Amish wedding foods. They can be found in some of the local
markets.</p>

meal guests with baskets of candy to hand out as favors. This gives them an
opportunity to greet all the guests personally. After the gifts are opened and
the guests begin to thin, it is time for the evening meal. The crowd is usually
much smaller by now. In some groups, the parent's will give their newlyweds
their first bedroom suite, handmade by the family or by another craftsman in
the community.</p>

young couple will typically sleep in the parent's home the first night. In some
groups the couple has to arise on the first morning of their married life and
wash all their clothes together. They take the couple's bed out into a field
along with a night stand on which they would place a lantern so they could find
it.</p>

continue to work part time outside the home, continuing her cleaning business

the main reasons they are called because of the way they dress. You will never

for women are all plain in color. The rules require the use of only solid
colors, and the colors usually consist of black, blue, burgundy, brown, purple

        <p class="u-text u-text-7">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The
men typically wear broad brimmed felt hats in the winter. The width of the brim
and the shape of the dome vary with the group. During the summer most groups
will allow their men to wear stroh hoots or straw hats. The style of straw hat
also lends a clue to the group the man is from. In the winter in some northern
climates men are allowed to wear tsiple kops or knit caps.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-8">Amish women </p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-9">When it comes to Amish women’s wardrobes, their wardrobes are
pretty small. They only believe they need four dresses.</p>
        <div class="u-palette-2-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-4"></div>
        <p class="u-text u-text-10">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amish women wear solid-color
dresses with long sleeves and a full skirt, covered with a cape on the bodice.
Some less conservative groups allow the women to wear short sleeved dresses but
never sleeveless. Clothing is fastened with straight pins or snaps, stockings are
black cotton and shoes are also black. Amish women are not permitted to wear
patterned clothing or jewelry.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-11">A
married woman wears a black cape and apron to church, with a plain colored
dress underneath, and a single woman wears a white cape and apron to church,
with a plain colored dress underneath. For working around the family farm,
women typically wear a gray apron. A woman’s cape and apron is fastened with
straight pins at the waist, in the front of their dress, to attach the two
together.&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="u-palette-2-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-5"></div>
        <p class="u-text u-text-12">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women go barefoot around the farm, and house,
and wear black shoes and stockings for church services. Women also always wear
prayer caps, or head coverings, on their head, so that if they ever feel the
need to pray, throughout the day, their heads are covered and sacred to the
God.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-13">Amish
women never cut their hair, typically wearing it in a braid or bun on the back
of the head concealed with a small white cap called a covering.&nbsp; An Amish woman would never be seen outside
her home without her covering. When going to town or church they typically wear
a stiff black bonnet over their covering.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-14">Plain clothing marks the Amish as a people
apart. It emphasizes modesty, and Amish believe there is Biblical basis for
wearing it. Plain clothing has strong symbolic and religious value for the
Amish, and is one of the key visual markers of the culture. Clothing is a
marker that not only identifies the Amish as different from the rest of the
world, but also marks Amish communities as different from one another.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amish furniture is furniture made
by Amish people, mainly from Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio. This furniture is
generally known to be handmade, made entirely of wood. The styles most often
used by Amish wood​workers are generally traditional.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3">Great attention is paid to the details of the wood in the furniture
manufacturing process. Each piece of wood is manually selected to match the
specific furniture.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-4">Amish furniture is made from a variety of hardwoods, including Nordic red
oak, crushed white oak, cherry, maple, beech, elm, mahogany, walnut, hickory,
cedar and pine. Nordic red oak is a very popular choice for American consumers
for its warmth, color and durability.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-5">Although the Amish may not drive or use electricity in their homes, they
offer a wide range of furniture styles ranging from classic to contemporary.
And, regardless of style, you can trust that everything is done with their
attention without compromising on quality.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Amish hold worship services every two
weeks in their homes or barns. Sunday morning singing is limited to hymns from
the Ausbund, a collection of hymns written by early Anabaptists.</p>
        <div class="u-palette-2-base u-shape u-shape-rectangle u-shape-1"></div>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The songs are sung slowly, with many passing notes from one syllable to
the next. It can take five minutes to sing a single verse. At funerals no hymns
are sung, but a preacher usually reads a hymn. Written music is not used during
worship.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-4">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Besides their
Ausbund hymns, many Amish also sing popular hymns in English at informal
occasions, such as singings for the youth and family gatherings and visiting
with neighbors. Simple instruments, while not used in worship nor formally
approved, are found in social settings.</p>
